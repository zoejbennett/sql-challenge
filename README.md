## SQL Challenge

In this challenge, I built a database diagram to visualize the relationship between six CSV files describing previous employees of a fictional company. Using SQL, I set primary, composite, and foreign keys to relate the tables before performing a detailed analysis of the company and employees. 

In this repository are the relational database diagram, the schemata, and the queries performed. To complete this project, I utilized stack overflow as well as a bootcamp tutor for clarifying questions.
